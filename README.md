StewComic
=========

StewComic is a Qt-based comic viewer.

Why the deuce another comic viewer?
-----------

Well. There are great free (and opensource) comic viewers around, but I just wanted to do something a little different. Or not that different at all. I just wanted to make one myself.

Features
-----------

* Cross-platform
* CBZ / CBR files
* Double page display
* Manga reading (backwards)
* Comic Library
* Frame-by-frame view

State
--------------

Very, very, very early stage of development. I basically created a project on Qt Creator. That's it.

Contribute
--------------

If you want to help, go ahead. This project's license is... hmm, gotta think about that.

Development
--------------

If you want to help this project, all you need is:

* GCC / G++
* Qt Creator
* Passion for comics

Simple as that. Just clone the repo, open on your Qt creator (set your target, it doesn't matter which, you'll never commit the `stewcomic.pro.user` file anyway) and compile it. Then start hacking. :)
